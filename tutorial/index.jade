      ## Eta Notifications - Laundry On-Demand

      ![ETA Notifications](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/eta-notifications.png)

      There are a wide range of businesses that deliver goods or services to
      their customers on-demand. Companies like Uber, TaskRabbit, and
      Instacart have built an entire industry around the fact that we, the
      customer, like to order things instantly, wherever we are. The key to
      those services working is notifying customers instantly when things
      change.

      In this tutorial we'll build a notification system for Laundr.io, an
      on-demand laundry service.

      Let's get started!

  .step(
    data-title="Trigger the Notifications",
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/etanotifications/servlets/OrderDeliverServlet.java'
    data-highlight='32-51')
    :markdown
      ## Trigger the Notifications

      This screen shows two buttons that allow the laundry delivery person to
      trigger notifications. There are two cases we'd like to handle:

      1. Delivery person picks up laundry to be delivered.

      2. Delivery person is arriving to the customer's house.

      In a production app we would probably trigger the second notification
      when the delivery person is physically near the customer's house using GPS.
      For this case we'll just use a button.

      On the server we're going to use the Twilio API Client to actually
      send out the notifications.

  .step(
    data-title='Setting up the Twilio REST Client',
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/etanotifications/lib/MessageSender.java',
    data-highlight='19-24')
    :markdown
      ## Setting up the Twilio REST Client

      Here we create a helper class with an authenticated Twilio REST API
      client that we can use anytime we need to send a text message. We
      initialize it with our [Twilio Account
      Credentials](//www.twilio.com/user/account/settings) stored
      as environment variables.

  .step(
    data-title='Handling the Notification Trigger',
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/etanotifications/servlets/OrderPickupServlet.java',
    data-highlight='29-57')
    :markdown
      ## Handling the Notification Trigger

      This code handles the HTTP `POST` request triggered by the delivery
      person. It uses our `MessageSender` class to send an SMS message to the
      customer's phone number that is registered in our database.

      Next let's look closer at how we send the SMS.

  .step(
    data-title='Sending the Message',
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/etanotifications/lib/MessageSender.java',
    data-highlight='38-50')
    :markdown
      ## Sending the Message

      Here is how we actually send the SMS. If we want to improve
      the message we can send a picture of the laundry by adding:

      ```
      params.add(new BasicNameValuePair("MediaUrl", "http://lorempixel.com/image_output/fashion-q-c-640-480-1.jpg"));
      ```

      In addition to the required parameters, we can pass a `StatusCallback`
      url to let us know if the message was delivered. Let's take a closer
      look at how this works.

  .step(
    data-title='Handling the Twilio Callback',
    data-file='src/main/java/com/twilio/etanotifications/servlets/NotificationStatusServlet.java',
    data-highlight='30-36')
    :markdown
      ## Handling the Twilio Callback

      Twilio will make a post request to this servlet each time our message status changes to one
      of the following: queued, failed, sent, delivered, or undelivered.

      We then update this `notificationStatus` on the `Order` so that we can decide what to do next
      with it. This is a great place to add logic that would resend the message or send out an
      [automated survey](//www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/automated-survey/java/spring).

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We've just implemented an on-demand notification service that alerts our customers when their order is arriving. If you're a
